    <h2>About Me</h2>
    
    <p>I’m a self-qualified software engineer as proven by the existence of this website. I look vaguely like this, but in colour.</p>

    />
    
    <p>Currently I’m making and breaking things at Facebook London working on developer efficiency. Before joining Facebook, I did some math and computer science at IIT Delhi, while trying to avoid doing anything related with the <em>real</em> world.</p>
    
    <h2>Stuff I Claim I’ve Done</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40993-016-0055-5">Proved an obscure inequality in number theory</a> which this page is too short to explain.</li>
      <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=diYgXpktTqo">Talked (at a very fast pace) about some of the work</a> I’ve done at Facebook at <a href="https://www.seleniumconf.de">SeleniumConf 2017 in Berlin</a>. This was my <b>first</b> talk ever, so be kind.</li>
      <li>Created <a href="https://antiarchit.github.io">this website</a>, and a <a href="http://www.smyleinn.com">few</a> <a href="http://www.wupavhosting.ie/index.html">others</a>, with a survival rate of 50%.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    
    <h3>Why is your username <code>antiarchit</code>?</h3>
    
    <p>It was created at a time when I was interested in physics, and reading about matters such as antimatter and antiparticles. Since finding the handle <code>archit</code> was becoming hard on most websites, I decided to use <code>antiarchit</code> because why not.</p>
